In HTML, comments are used to include notes or annotations within the code that are not visible to the users when they view the webpage.
The primary purpose of comments in HTML is to provide information to developers and maintainers of the code, helping them understand the structure and functionality of the HTML document. 
Comments are ignored by web browsers and do not affect the rendering or behavior of the webpage.

HTML comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags. 
Anything placed between these tags is treated as a comment and is not displayed on the webpage.
