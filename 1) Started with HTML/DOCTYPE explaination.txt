The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML (Document Type Declaration) is the beginning of an HTML document,
that specifies the type of document and version of HTML being used. 

Example of a DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
  		<!-- The rest of your HTML content goes here -->
	</html>

In the above example, <!DOCTYPE html> declares that the document is written in HTML5.
It is essential because it helps ensure that web browsers and other software interpret your code correctly.
